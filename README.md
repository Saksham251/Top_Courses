A top courses website built with React.js utilizes components like course cards and navigation menus for a dynamic UI. It employs state management using hooks (useState, useEffect) or libraries like Redux, and uses React Router for client-side routing. Data is fetched using Fetch API or Axios, and styling is managed with CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components. The site is optimized using Webpack for a seamless and responsive user experience.
